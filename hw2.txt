2.24
	A jump to 0x4000 0000 is not possible because the jump instruction 
	can't move to an address bigger than 26 bits in one instruction

	The branch-on-equal struction would not work since it can only use
	16 bits for the address

2.26.1
	LOOP: slt $t2, $0, $t1		// 0<10 initially
		beq $t2, $0, DONE	// quit when $t1 is 0
		subi $t1, $t1, 1	// subtract 1 from $t1 each loop
		addi $s2, $s2, 2	// $s2 = $s2 + 2
		j LOOP
	DONE:

	Loops 10 times so $s2 should be 20

2.26.3
	Each loop has 5 instructions with 2 instructions for last loop before DONE
	5N + 2 instructions total

2.46.1
	CPI*intructions for arithmetic = 500m*1 = 500m
	CPI*intructions for load/store = 300m*10 = 3000m
	CPI*intructions for branch = 100m*3 = 300m

	Execution time = 3800m * cycle time

	New number of arithmetic instructions = 375m
	
	New execution time = 3675m * 1.1 * cycle time = 4042.5 * cycle time

	Bad idea since it increases the execution time
